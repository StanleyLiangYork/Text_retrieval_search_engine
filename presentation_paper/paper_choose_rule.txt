Please form your group in the first week of the lecture.
Send the instructor your group member (2 students) and your initial choice.
The instructor will follow the 'first bid first get' principle to assign the presentation papers.
If a paper is chosen by more than one group, the instructor will send you a new list of paper for your second choice.
If a paper still picked by more than one group, the insturctor will make the choice for your group.
The final paper allocation will be sent out before the end of January.
